Image conversion through ImageMagick, 'convert', 'GIMP', etc, will not preserve the prompt information stored as metadata which can be used to create similar images again.

This 'convert.py' file will preserve this information when converting from PNG to JPG to spave space.


Dependencies known usable include at least:
>Python 3.9.16
pip3 install piexif
